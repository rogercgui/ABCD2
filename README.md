<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
![module_cataloging](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64411779/221262002-5b36053b-8294-4a67-aa63-804acb6e5e63.png)



Acronym **ABCD** stands for:

> **A**utomatización de **B**ibliotecas y **C**entros de **D**ocumentación<br>
> **A**utomation des **B**ibliothèques et **C**entres de **D**ocumentacion<br>
> **A**utomatização das **B**ibliotecas e dos **C**entros de **D**ocumentação<br>
> **A**utomatisering van **B**ibliotheken en **C**entra voor **D**ocumentatie

ABCD was initially developed by [Bireme](http://regional.bvsalud.org/local/Site/bireme/I/homepage.htm) with the support of [VLIR/UOS](https://www.vliruos.be/en/home/1) and based on [UNESCO-supported ISIS-technology](http://www.unesco.org/isis). Currently the development is solely done by volunteers in several countries but not enough thanks can be given to G. Ascencio and E. Spinak.

---

The name itself already expresses the ambition of the software suite : not only providing automation functions for
the 'classic' libraries but also other information providers such as documentation centres. Flexibility and versatility
are at the forefront of the criteria on which the software is developed. This flexibility e.g. is illustrated by the
fact that in principle, but also practically, any bibliographic structure can be managed by the software, or even
created by itself. Even non-bibliographic structures can be created, as long as the information is mainly 'textual'
information, as this is the limitation put by the underlying database technology, which is the (CDS/)ISIS textual
database. Good understanding of some basic ISIS-related concepts and techniques, e.g. the Formatting Language,
is crucial for full mastering of the ABCD-software. For this reason some sections of this Manual will also deal
with the underlying ISIS-technology.

ABCD is called a 'suite' of softwares for library and documentation centres automation because it exists of some
relatively independent modules, which can fully co-operate but also can exist without each other. In fact some
existing advanced softwares, mostly having already shown their potential in demanding environments in BIREME-
applications (within the Virtual Health Library context), were adopted and adapted into ABCD - that is why the
original names such as iAH, SeCS (both developed by BIREME) and EmpWeb (Empréstimos en Web) developed
originally by KALIO ltda. of Uruguay and amply tested in Valparaiso at the University) are maintained. These main
parts are shown, with their hierarchical relationships, at the second level in the following picture:

### Built With

ABCD is being written using the languages.
* [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
* [CISIS](https://wiki.bireme.org/pt/index.php/CISIS)
* [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
* [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)


<!-- DOWNLOAD and Install -->
## Installation
ABCD is supported on **Windows** and **Linux**  
[Download the latest ABCD release](https://abcd-community.org/dowloads/)  
[Download all code from GitHub ABCD-DEVCOM / ABCD](https://github.com/ABCD-DEVCOM/ABCD)  
 

Installation prerequisites and installation procedure vary by version and by installed components.
See [Installation folder](https://github.com/ABCD-DEVCOM/ABCD/tree/master/zz_installation) for detailed instructions and material.
Note that the ABCD downloads do not include software prerequisites

[Download EmpWeb](https://github.com/ABCD-Community/EmpWeb)

`EmpWeb` has additional prerequisites (SQL,Java). Details in the repository.



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

You can try the ABCD software on an online installation of the ABCD. All features that you can access come with the default installation package of ABCD.

Our demo version is synchronized with the development in the Github repository, so there may be some bugs.

We will soon make a more stable demo version available in parallel with development for comparison
